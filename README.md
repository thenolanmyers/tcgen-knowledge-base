# Vision

TCGen is a tech-enabled change management methodology to improve your product development process.

We will leverage a public handbook, a la [GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com), that allows us to create living documentation that is ever growing and allows us to collaborate efficiently and share knowledge with our clients.

## Handbook-First

We strive to be "handbook-first" in our approach to serving clients. By writing our thoughts, we increase the amount that can be tackled asynchronously, and promote consistency of interpretation across teams within a client. It also allows us to build upon our knowledge over time, refining and building with each implementation.

### Handbook-first usage

To be "handbook-first" we employ the following practices.

1. Write it first. Document the proposed methodology so that others can understand specifically what you mean.&#x20;
2. Share links. Send links to documentation rather than emails or presentations. People can get the main point effectively, and have richer context if they want to explore more.

### Benefits of handbook-first

Writing knowledge to the handbook first has these benefits:

* Don't duplicate work
* Allow comments -- from us and clients
* Improve incrementally
* Share in context

### Concerns with our handbook approach

Our handbook-methodologies were formed in a product company where compounding results were important. In the TCGen context, some things we have yet to prove out:

1. Will a handbook be effective in a services and coaching context? We provide highly context-sensitive advice. Will that be possible with a handbook? Will it be well received, even if technically feasible? (e.g. the workflow of receiving links instead of emails is super efficient, but not yet common practice.)
2. How will we handle deviations? Though our methodology is powerful, variations often are appropriate, or a recommendation in one context won't make sense in another.
